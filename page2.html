        <h1>DATA PROCESSING SYSTEM</h1>

        <p class="content">
          The space shuttle vehicle relies on computerized control and monitoring
          for successful performance. The data processing system, through the use of
          various hardware components and its self-contained computer programming
          (software), provides the vehicle with this monitoring and control.
          The DPS hardware consists of five general-purpose computers for computation
          and control, two magnetic tape mass memory units for large-volume bulk storage,
          a time-shared computer data bus network consisting of serial digital data buses
          (essentially party lines) to accommodate the data traffic between the GPCs and
          space shuttle vehicle systems, 19 orbiter and four solid rocket booster
          multiplexers/demultiplexers to convert and format data from the various vehicle
          systems, three space shuttle main engine interface units to command the SSMEs,
          four multifunction CRT display systems used by the flight crew to monitor and
          control the vehicle and payload systems, two data bus isolation amplifiers
          to interface with the ground support equipment/launch processing system and
          the solid rocket boosters, two master events controllers, and a master
          timing unit.
          
          The software stored in and executed by the GPCs is the most sophisticated and
          complex set of programs ever developed for aero space use. The programs are
          written to accommodate almost every aspect of space shuttle operations, including orbiter checkout at Rockwell's Palmdale, Calif., assembly facility; space shuttle vehicle prelaunch and final countdown for launch; turnaround activities at the Kennedy Space Center.and eventually Vandenberg Air Force Base; control and monitoring during launch ascent, on-orbit activities, entry and landing; and aborts or other contingency mission phases. A multicomputer mode is used for the critical phases of the mission, such as launch, ascent, entry, landing and aborts.
          
          Some of the DPS functions are as follows: support the guidance, navigation and
          control of the vehicle, including calculations of trajectories, SSME thrusting
          data and vehicle attitude control data; process vehicle data for the flight crew
          and for transmission to the ground and allow ground control of some vehicle
          systems via transmitted commands; check data transmission errors and crew control
          put errors; support annunciation of vehicle system failures and out-of-tolerance
          system conditions; support payloads with flight crew/software interface for
          activation, deployment, deactivation and retrieval; process rendezvous, tracking
          and data transmissions between payloads and the ground; and monitor and control
          vehicle subsystems.
