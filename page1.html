        <h1>AVIONICS SYSTEM</h1>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <img src="img/andres-dallimonti-kjqTlMHLci4-unsplash.jpg" alt="Image">
        <p class="content">The space shuttle avionics system controls,
          or assists in controlling, most of the shuttle systems. Its
          functions include automatic determination of the vehicle's
          status and operational readiness; implementation sequencing
          and control for the solid rocket boosters and external tank
          during launch and ascent; performance monitoring; digital data
          processing; communications and tracking; payload and system
          management; guidance, navigation and control; and electrical
          power distribution for the orbiter, external tank and solid
          rocket boosters.
          Automatic vehicle flight control can be used for every phase of
          the mission except docking, which is a manual operation performed
          by the flight crew. Manual control-referred to as the control stick
          steering mode-also is available at all times as a flight crew option.
          
          The avionics equipment is arranged to facilitate checkout, access
          and replacement with minimal disturbance to other systems. Almost
          all electrical and electronic equipment is installed in three areas
          of the orbiter: the flight deck, the three avionics equipment bays
          in the middeck of the orbiter crew compartment and the three avionics
          equipment bays in the orbiter aft fuselage. The flight deck of the
          orbiter crew compartment is the center of avionics activity, both in
          flight and on the ground. Before launch, the orbiter avionics system
          is linked to ground support equipment through umbilical connections.
          
          The space shuttle avionics system consists of more than 300 major electronic
          black boxes located throughout the vehicle, connected by more than 300 miles
          of electrical wiring. There are approximately 120,400 wire segments and 6,491
          connectors in the vehicle. The wiring and connectors weigh approximately 7,000
          pounds, wiring alone weighing approximately 4,600 pounds. Total weight of the
          black boxes, wiring and connectors is approximately 17,116 pounds.
          
          The black boxes are connected to a set of five general-purpose computers through
          common party lines called data buses. The black boxes offer dual or triple
          redundancy for every function.
          
          The avionics are designed to withstand multiple failures through redundant hardware
          and software (computer programs) managed by the complex of five computers; this
          arrangement is called a fail-operational/fail-safe capability. Fail-operational
          performance means that, after one failure in a system, redundancy management
          allows the vehicle to continue on its mission. Fail-safe means that after a second
          failure, the vehicle still is capable of returning to a landing site safely.
